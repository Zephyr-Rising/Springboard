# Springboard

This is my repository for Springboard's Data Science Career Track!  Check out the projects I'm working on:

1. League of Legends Capstone Project:

For my League of Legends capstone project, I would like to find, using data science techniques, the traits for professional players and teams that lead to success or failure.  I plan to use Oracle Elixirâ€™s (A well known LCS analysis blog) database as a base for my analysis, while adding onto it by scraping more detailed information from the official match history data from the LCS website.  In doing this, I hope to improve the eSports broadcast team, by allowing them to give more detailed information.
